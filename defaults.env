# |  Networking.localhost  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# If "exposeNetworkWithoutAuth" is false, what value should PhotoStructure use
# for localhost? (Some firewalls are OK with "127.0.0.1", some require
# "localhost"). This is a library setting.
#
# PS_LOCALHOST="127.0.0.1"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––+

#
# Network port for HTTP access to your PhotoStructure library. This is a library
# setting.
#
# PS_HTTP_PORT="1787"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  Networking.exposeNetworkWithoutAuth  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Normally the web service is only accessible to the computer running
# PhotoStructure. Setting this to true will expose your library to all computers
# on your network. You should own or trust all systems on that network, as there
# is no auth in PhotoStructure currently. Future versions of PhotoStructure will
# add authorization mechanisms, at which point this setting will be deleted.
#
# **Don't enable this unless you know what you are doing**. This is a library
# setting.
#
# PS_EXPOSE_NETWORK_WITHOUT_AUTH="false"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  Networking.rpcPort  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Network port for rpc access to your PhotoStructure library. Only binds to

# setting.
#
# PS_RPC_PORT="1807"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  Networking.cspReportOnly  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Only report CSP violations. See
# <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP>. This is a library
# setting.
#
# PS_CSP_REPORT_ONLY="false"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  Networking.cspDirective  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# If you're seeing CSP errors with older browsers, add your externally-available
# base URL to this setting, and it will be appended to the CSP directives. See
# <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src>.
# This is a library setting.
#
# PS_CSP_DIRECTIVE=


# +––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.maxBusyDbMs  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# SQLite supports concurrent readers but concurrent writers may collide, causing
# a LOCKED or BUSY error. PhotoStructure will retry the db operation for
# maxBusyDbMs milliseconds. This defaults to 1 minute, which seems like a long
# time, but hard drives and network filesystems can take 10-20 seconds to spin
# up if asleep. This is a system setting.
#
# PS_MAX_BUSY_DB_MS="60000"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.dbTimeoutMs  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# SQLite can time out requests if the db file is unavailable. PhotoStructure
# will retry those requests (up to `maxBusyDbMs`). A shorter time may help
# overall throughput, but may require more work done in retry logic. A longer
# time may be better for slower machines and slower disks. Setting this too low
# will cause all database queries to fail. This is a system setting.
#
# PS_DB_TIMEOUT_MS="1000"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.setupTimeoutMs  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# To prevent unhealthy services running as zombies, they self-terminate if the
# setup processes are not complete within this amount of time. Note that only
# the environment variable value is used for this setting. This is a system
# setting.
#
# PS_SETUP_TIMEOUT_MS="35000"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.probationMs  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Normally when subsystems crash, PhotoStructure restarts them after a delay.
# Unfortunately, if there is a persistent error, this means PhotoStructure keeps
# trying something that won't ever work; it looks busy, but it's just busy
# failing. To prevent this situation, PhotoStructure will shut down if there are
# high error rates within 2 minutes of starting. (2 minutes should be long
# enough to spin up the web process, sync process, and import at least one
# pending file). Setting this to 0 will prevent PhotoStructure from exiting due
# to high error rates. This is a system setting.
#
# PS_PROBATION_MS="120000"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.minTimeBetweenServiceRestartsMs  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# If a service (like web, sync, or sync-file) is restarted due to an error, how
# many ms must elapse before another restart is allowed? This helps prevent
# system load due to service flapping. This is a system setting.
#
# PS_MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_SERVICE_RESTARTS_MS="7000"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.fatalErrorRatePerMinute  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# If PhotoStructure sees errors at a higher rate per minute than this setting,
# PhotoStructure will shut down. If this value is too high, PhotoStructure may
# look busy, but it's just busyfailing. If this value is set too low, temporary
# errors (due to network flakiness or USB hiccups) might shut down
# PhotoStructure needlessly. This is a system setting.
#
# PS_FATAL_ERROR_RATE_PER_MINUTE="10"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.autoLaunch  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Set to true to have PhotoStructure start automatically on login. Only
# supported on PhotoStructure for Desktops on macOS and Windows 10. This is a
# system setting.
#
# PS_AUTO_LAUNCH="false"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.minDiskFreeGb  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# PhotoStructure will pause processing if the GB free on the disk that your
# library is stored on drops below this value. The value provided here will be
# multiplied by 1000^3. Note that many OSes will corrupt themselves when disks
# fill up, and SSDs can fail as they approach full capacity. A value of less
# than 8 may be unsafe (due to hibernation and os update files). This is a
# system setting.
#
# PS_MIN_DISK_FREE_GB="6"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.cpuLoadPercent  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# PhotoStructure runs many things in parallel during library synchronization.
# The maximum number of concurrent file imports that PhotoStructure will
# schedule at a time will be the number of CPUs that this system has multiplied
# by this percent. A higher value here will allow PhotoStructure to run more
# tasks in parallel, but may impact your system's responsiveness. 75% should be
# a reasonable balance between keeping your system responsive and importing your
# library quickly. Setting this value to 0 will still allow 1 task to run
# concurrently. System memory will also be taken into account to try to prevent
# swapping. This is a system setting.
#
# PS_CPU_LOAD_PERCENT="75"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.processPriority  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# By default, PhotoStructure runs child processes with a "below normal"
# priority, so your system remains usable while imports run. Changing this value
# to "normal" or "above normal" may speed up imports but cause your system to be
# unresponsive. Changing this value to "idle" may prevent imports from running
# at all. This is a system setting.
#
# PS_PROCESS_PRIORITY="BelowNormal"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.maxMemoryMb  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# PhotoStructure will restart services if they use more than this value
# (measured in megabytes, or 1,000,000 bytes). Note that this is not the
# allocated memory. See maxRssMemoryMb for total allocated. This is a system
# setting.
#
# PS_MAX_MEMORY_MB="500"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.maxRssMemoryMb  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# PhotoStructure will restart services if their' resident set size consumes more
# than this value (measured in megabytes, or 1,000,000 bytes). This is a system
# setting.
#
# PS_MAX_RSS_MEMORY_MB="1000"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.maxTasksPerProcess  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# PhotoStructure will recycle sync-file processes after they handle this number
# of requests. Smaller values may reduce overall memory pressure. Larger values
# amortize startup costs over fewer restarts. This is a system setting.
#
# PS_MAX_TASKS_PER_PROCESS="10"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.pollIntervalMs  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# The number of milliseconds we wait between polling for changes in remote
# filesystems. This defaults to 1 minute, to minimize remote filesystem load.
# This is a system setting.
#
# PS_POLL_INTERVAL_MS="5000"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.copyAssetsToLibrary  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Should PhotoStructure copy photos and videos to your PhotoStructure Library?
# This is a system setting.
#
# PS_COPY_ASSETS_TO_LIBRARY="true"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.scanAllDrives  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Should PhotoStructure scan all folders on all drives available to this
# computer for photos and videos? This is a system setting.
#
# PS_SCAN_ALL_DRIVES="true"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.scanMyPictures  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Deprecated, and will be removed in the next version. If set, PhotoStructure
# will automatically add your pictures directory to your `scanPaths` setting.
# This is a system setting.
#
# PS_SCAN_MY_PICTURES="false"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.scanLibraryFirst  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Should PhotoStructure scan your library before any other paths? This makes
# sure your library database is in sync with the files in your library. This is
# a system setting.
#
# PS_SCAN_LIBRARY_FIRST="true"


# +––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.scanPaths  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# This holds an array of absolute paths to scan for assets. If you are setting
# this via an environment variable, you may use either standard PATH formatting,
# like `PS_SCAN_PATHS="/path/one:/path/two"`, or use JSON encoding, like
# `PS_SCAN_PATHS='["/path/one","/path/two"]'`. This is a system setting.
#
# PS_SCAN_PATHS=


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.neverIgnored  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Paths to files or directories that should not be ignored, even if they are
# hidden or have .nomedia files. This is a system setting.
#
# PS_NEVER_IGNORED=


# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.validateMountpoints  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# When true, PhotoStructure ignores volumes whose mountpoints do not exist. This
# is a system setting.
#
# PS_VALIDATE_MOUNTPOINTS="true"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.readVolumeUuidFiles  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# When true, PhotoStructure uses ".uuid" files found in the root directory of
# volumes as the volume UUID, which can help with cross-host library
# portability. Set this to false if you don't want PhotoStructure to read these
# ".uuid" files. See https://photostructure.com/faq/what-is-a-volume for more
# information. This is a system setting.
#
# PS_READ_VOLUME_UUID_FILES="true"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.writeVolumeUuidFiles  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# When true, PhotoStructure (tries to) write ".uuid" files into the root
# directory of volumes, which enables cross-host library portability. Set this
# to false if you don't want PhotoStructure to try to write these ".uuid" files.
# See https://photostructure.com/faq/what-is-a-volume for more information. This
# is a system setting.
#
# PS_WRITE_VOLUME_UUID_FILES="true"


# +––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.toolPaths  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# These paths are appended to the PATH to ensure PhotoStructure can find and run
# external tools like ffmpeg. Use your operating system's separator to separate
# paths (":" for mac and linux, ";" for windows). This is a system setting.
#
# PS_TOOL_PATHS="[\"/usr/local/sbin\",\"/usr/local/bin\",\"/opt/local/sbin\",\"/opt/local/bin\",\"/usr/sbin\",\"/usr/bin\",\"/sbin\",\"/bin\"]"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  System.forceLocalDbReplica  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Libraries on remote filesystems can suffer from bad performance and
# inconsistent transactions due to slow file I/O and missing file locking
# mechanics. When opening libraries on remote filesystems, or if this setting is
# `true`, PhotoStructure will copy the library database to the `cacheDir` and
# perform I/O against this local replica. Changes made to the local db replica
# are then periodically copied back to the remote library. This is a system
# setting.
#
# PS_FORCE_LOCAL_DB_REPLICA="false"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  Db.dbBackupsCount  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# How many prior backups should PhotoStructure retain? These will typically be
# 10-500 MB, depending on the size of your library. This is a library setting.
#
# PS_DB_BACKUPS_COUNT="20"


# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  Db.dbBackupIntervalMinutes  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# How many minutes should elapse between backing of your library database? Note
# that PhotoStructure vacuums and optimizes the database before a backup is
# taken. You want this period to be frequent enough such that data loss isn't
# too painful. Note that backups can cause the webserver to be momentarily
# unresponsive. Default is every hour. This is a library setting.
#
# PS_DB_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES="0.5"


# +––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  Db.dbCacheSizeMb  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# PhotoStructure uses SQLite, and the cache_size pragma should ideally be set
# such that the whole DB can be in memory. See

# a library setting.
#
# PS_DB_CACHE_SIZE_MB="128"


# +––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  Tools.ffmpegPath  |
# +––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# This should be the absolute, native path to the "ffmpeg" binary on this

# PS_FFMPEG_PATH="ffmpeg"


# +–––––––––––––––––+
# |  Tools.vlcPath  |
# +–––––––––––––––––+
#
# This should be the absolute, native path to the "vlc" binary on this system.

# PS_ENABLE_SIMD="false"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  Tools.enableVipsCache  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Should PhotoStructure enable VIPS caching, which may help speed up image

# system setting.
#
# PS_ENABLE_VIPS_CACHE="false"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  Tools.powerShellCulture  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# If set to a non-blank value, PhotoStructure on Windows machines will set
# PowerShell's `[System.Threading.Thread]::CurrentThread.CurrentCulture` to this
# value. This allows PhotoStructure to parse PowerShell output reliably. This is
# a system setting.
#
# PS_POWER_SHELL_CULTURE="en-US"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  Updates.updateChannel  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# TL:DR; keep this on "latest." This controls which builds of PhotoStructure you
# are eligible to automatically update to. Please note that "alpha" builds may

# PS_SESSION_TIMEOUT_HOURS="4320"


# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
# |  Sync.verifyFileCopies  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Should PhotoStructure verify all file copies by comparing SHAs of the source

# |  Sync.validateVideos  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––––––+
#
# Should videos be validated before importing? If a video has any decoding
# errors, and this setting is true, that file will not be imported into your
